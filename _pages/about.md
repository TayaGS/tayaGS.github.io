I'm Taya, I work on various high-energy astrophysics transients, using analytical methods alongside numerical simulations. I'm specifically interested in problems in which the hydrodynamics of shock waves is coupled to emission processes, and get very excited when I can test my theory against observations. My research so far can be put into roughly three categories.
1. I'm currently thinking about various aspects of **Supernovae interacting with thick CSM**. Including a general analytical model for the optical and x-ray lightcurve and broadband spectra for these types of events, a detailed study of **x-ray absorption and reprocessing**- the ability of x-ray to photoionize or Compton heat its way through the upstream medium, and the impact a clumpy upsream can have, if it drives **turbulent cooling** in the downstream. I'm especially happy to have the abundance of observations of **SN2023ixf** to test my model against.
2. The fluid dynamical [evolution of jetted blast waves](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.531.1704G/abstract), and what that means for [measuring the geometry of off-axis GRB jets](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.524..403G/abstract). We show that using the light curve and VLBI observations of the centroid motion, we can measure the core angle at the time of the peak, the observing angle, the initial jet structure, and even constrain the initial jet core angle. Applying these models to **GW170817** makes it the GRB with the most well-constrained geometry. The jet viewing angle can also help in measuring **H0**, by breaking the degeneracy between the distance and viewing angle when using binary neutron star mergers as standard sirens. 
3. The hydrodynamical evolution of spherical shock waves in expanding media, in the [Newtonian](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...907..113G/abstract) and [relativistic](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.528..313G/abstract) cases. These are neat hydro problems in which the shocks generally don't follow a self-similar solution.


You can read more about my research in the [research](https://tayags.github.io/research/) tab, or have a look at my [papers](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq_database=(database%3Aastronomy%20OR%20database%3Aphysics)&q=author%3A%22Govreen-Segal%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) on ADS. 


I'm currently in a direct PhD program at Tel Aviv University, advised by Ehud Nakar. Before that, I did my undergraduate studies in physics and mathematics at Tel-Aviv University. 


**When I'm not doing physics**, you can find me rock climbing (hopefully at the crag and not on plastic). 

I volunteer at [HerAcademy](https://www.heracademy.org.il/en/), where we provide vocational training for women coming out of prostitution and violence. The students I meet there are the most dedicated I've met, putting aside the hell they've gone through for two hours, so they can learn to read or use a computer for the first time.
